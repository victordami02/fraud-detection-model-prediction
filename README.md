# fraud-detection-model-prediction
This project mainly focuses on handling imbalanced datasets and detecting credit-card frauds using different Machine Learning Algorithms.

These models are fittted to different datasets acquired after StandardScaler, Oversampling, Undersampling and SMOTE techniques. Thus, separate files are created for each Machine Learning Models so that every datasets acquired after above mentioned techniques are fitted separately to our model using single function.
